Abstract:

    The light curves and periodograms of over 20000 stars in the Kepler 
    field were visually examined in order to detect the various classes
    of variables.  Among these are 2570 stars of the delta Scuti and
    gamma Doradus types.  Parallaxes from Gaia DR2 were obtained for
    2476 of these variables, from which precise stellar luminosities were
    derived.  The effective temperatures of stars with effective
    temperatures less than 6500 K were obtained from the Huber et al.
    2014ApJS..211....2H.  For hotter stars, 144 K was added to the KIC values 
    in accordance with Balona et al. 2015MNRAS.452.3073B.  Interstellar 
    absorption in the V band was obtained by linear interpolation of the 3D
    table by Gontcharov 2017AstL...43..472G.  For stars more distant than
    1200 pc, the absorption was assumed to follow the simple model described
    in Brown et al. 2011AJ....142..112B adjusted to give the same value at
    1200 pc.  The de-reddening procedure to the KIC griz values followed the 
    procedure outlined in Pinsonneault et al. 2012ApJS..199...30P, from which 
    the unreddened r magnitude was obtained. The absolute r magnitude was then
    obtained from the Gaia DR2 parallax (Gaia Collaboration, 
    2018arXiv180409365G) and using the bolometric correction in the r band 
    from Castelli and Kurucz, 2004astro.ph..5087C) the absolute bolometric 
    magnitude was derived.  The 2476 stars for which luminosities could be 
    calculated are listed in Table 1.

    Luminosities could not be obtained for some of the delta Scuti and gamma 
    Doradus stars identified in the Kepler field, either because the
    parallax was not measured or because the effective temperature could not
    be estimated.  These stars are listed in Table 2.

    Code names were developed to describe the variability class of each star
    as follows:

    DSCT:  delta Scuti star
    GDOR:  gamma Doradus star
    GDORA: gamma Doradus star with asymmetric light curve.
    GDORS: gamma Doradus star with symmetric light curve.
    GDORM: gamma Doradus star with multiple frequencies.

    In addition  to these basic types, evidence was found for other types of
    variation in the same star as follows:

    ROT:   Rotational variable
    EB:    Eclipsing binary
    HRTB:  Heartbeat binary
    MAIA:  High frequencies in a star between the red edge of the beta Cep
           variables and the blue edge of the delta Scuti variables.
    SOLR:  Solar-like frequency comb seen in periodogram.
    SPB:   Low frequencies in a star cooler than the red edge of the SPB
           variables and hotter than the blue edge of the gamma Dor variables.

Description:
    KIC numbers, variability type and stellar parameters for delta Scuti and
    gamma Doradus stars in the Kepler field.

Note on table1.dat, table2.dat: The effective temperature and its standard 
deviation is from the Huber et al. 2014ApJS..211....2H for Teff < 6500.  For 
hotter stars Teff is from the KIC, but increased by 144 K in accordance 
with Balona et al. 2015MNRAS.452.3073B.
Note on table2.dat: The luminosity is calculated from Teff and the KIC stellar
radius.  The standard deviation in log(L/L_sun) is about 0.4 dex.
